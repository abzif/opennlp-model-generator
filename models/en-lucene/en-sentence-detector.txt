One answer is that the Pentagon prevented the State Department from running the CPA.
State is the body with experience in international affairs and administration.
The civilians in the Department of Defense only know how to blow things up.
Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz and Feith staffed the CPA with Neoconservatives, most of whom had no administrative experience, no Arabic, and no respect for Muslim culture (or knowledge about it).
They actively excluded State Department Iraq hands like Tom Warrick.
(Only recently have a few experienced State Department Arabists been allowed in to try to begin mopping up the mess.)
The Neocons in the CPA have all sorts of ulterior motives and social experiments they want to impose on the Iraqi people, including Polish-style economic shock therapy, some sort of sweetheart deal for Israel, and maybe even breaking the country up into three parts.
The Washington Monthly's Who's Who of Neocons in Iraq helps explain the extreme incompetence and possibly double-dealing of many in the CPA.
Sept. 11 Commission member Philip Zelikow, who is close to the Bush administration, admitted on Sept. 10, 2002, that the ulterior motive of the Bush administration for the Iraq War was to "protect Israel," according to the Asian Times .
I have long been a trenchant critic of the Sadrists.

Let me know when you get the quotes from Pauline.
I am expecting to pay something in the $3,to $5,000 range.
I would like to see the quotes and a description of the work to be done.
It is my understanding that some rock will be removed and replaced with siding.
If they are getting quotes to put up new rock then we will need to clarify.
Jacques is ready to drop in a dollar amount on the release.
If the negotiations stall, it seems like I need to go ahead and cut off the utilities.

With protests going on in the Chilean capital of Santiago (from the economic summit), President Bush visited Chinese President Hu Jintao and other key allies in Santiago.
The talk of the day besides a more level playing field with China was North Korea.
China has been a great help at getting North Korea to the table and Bush is hoping that with their cooperation Korea can become a nuclear free peninsula.

U.S. astronauts will launch to the moon on sleek, single, shuttle booster rockets and the first new upper-stage rocket this country has developed in more than a decade, NASA and the Pentagon have told the White House.
Lunar landers and other gear needed for extended visits to the moon will be lofted by gargantuan launchers as big as the Apollo-era Saturn 5, the most powerful rockets ever flown.
It looks as if NASA is transitioning away from the shuttle model, as in the past they have proven to be quite dangerous as Columbia has recently proved.
Although these new rockets are probably more expensive, they will be able to go at a much greater range than it's shuttle cousins, as they can not only break free from the atmosphere but reach the moon as well.
"NASA then plans to develop a new 100-metric-ton-class launch vehicle derived from existing capabilities with the space shuttle external tanks and solid rocket boosters for future missions to the moon," the letter said.

Over the past decade, Bangladesh has steadily moved into a state of lawlessness.
It is widely acknowledged that the Pakistani ISI has nurtured a number of extremist Islamist groups, such as the Harkat-ul-Jehad-al-Islami, in the port city of Chittagong, and put a number of secessionist rebels from India's northeast in touch with this terrorist network.
As a result, north of the Andaman Islands, Bangladeshi coastal areas have become a nest of terrorists involved in the shipment of drugs and arms.
A pattern of arrests and seizures indicate that arms are brought by the LTTE from Laos, Cambodia and Thailand into Chittagong, from where they are transported northward by land to Bhutan.
The route from Kalikhola in Bhutan to Cox's Bazar passes through northern Bengal, Assam and Meghalaya, and on into Chittagong.
Note
India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands comprise more than 500 islands lying 1,000 kilometers east of Sri Lanka in the Bay of Bengal.
Stretching 750 kilometers from end to end, they reach from near the coast of Myanmar almost to Sumatra in Indonesia.
The Ten Degree Channel divides the Andamans, which are the larger and more heavily populated northern islands, from the 20 or so Nicobar Islands in the south.
On South Andaman, the most heavily populated island, is Port Blair, which is the capital and the only large town in the entire archipelago.

The history of alcoholism and possibly other drug use is a key issue because it not only speaks to Bush's character as an addictive personality, but may tell us something about his erratic and alarming actions as president.
His explosive temper probably provoked the disastrous siege of Fallujah last spring, killing 600 Iraqis, most of them women and children, in revenge for the deaths of 4 civilian mercenaries, one of them a South African.
(Newsweek reported that Bush commanded his cabinet, "Let heads roll!")
That temper is only one problem.
Bush has a sadistic streak.
He clearly enjoyed, as governor, watching executions.
His delight in killing people became a campaign issue in 2000 when he seemed, in one debate, to enjoy the prospect of executing wrong-doers a little too much.
He has clearly gone on enjoying killing people on a large scale in Iraq.

Like the tens of billions of dollars that have been "lost" in Iraq, planeloads of arms don't just "vanish"; not when the Pentagon contracts the work to an international criminal of Bout's untouchable stature.
But Bout's name isn't likely to be mentioned in whatever coverage this story receives, before it sinks like so many others beneath the media's frothing triviality.
Meanwhile, a decision's been reached in the trial of Toledo priest Gerald Robinson.
And it's guilty :
The Rev. Gerald Robinson appeared stony-faced as the jury's guilty verdict was read, and he blinked repeatedly and glanced at his lawyers before being led away in handcuffs.
...
The crime occurred in the sacristy adjoining the hospital chapel in downtown Toledo on the Saturday before Easter in 1980.
Investigators said the nun, Margaret Ann Pahl, 71, was strangled and then stabbed, with nine wounds on her chest forming the shape of an inverted cross, a well-recognized Satanic symbol.
An altar cloth was draped over her half-naked body, which was posed as if she had been sexually assaulted.

Suicide murders are not a new invention but they have been made popular, if I may use this expression, only lately.

September 11 was quantitatively much less lethal than many earthquakes

Zawahiri was associated with a faction of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad known as the Vanguards of Conquest.
Zawahiri and the Vanguards of Conquest were seeking to recreate Mohammed's taking of mecca by a small band through violent attacks on Egyptian leaders.
By 1998, Zawahiri had determined that the Egyptian Islamic Jihad should focus on its struggle against the United States and hold off on further attacks against the Egyptian regime.
A key question is how they acquired the anthrax strain first isolated by the Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Lab in 1980.
According to senior counter terrorism officials, both here and abroad, among the supporters of these militant islamists were people who blended into society and were available to act when another part of the network requested it.

In early June 2003, a Central Intelligence Agency ("CIA") report publicly disclosed that the reason for Mohammed Atta's and Zacarias Moussaoui's inquiries into cropdusters was for the contemplated use in dispersing biological agents such as anthrax.
An early September 2003 Newsweek article included a rumor by a Taliban source that at a meeting in April 2003 Bin Laden was planning an "unbelievable" biological attack, the plans for which had suffered a setback upon the arrest of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed ("KSM").

1. The pricing that we have given CRRA is specific to FuelCell Energy and would not be meaningful without listing the manufacturer (i.e., ONSI would be a lot more money).
Hence, I think that we have to reference the manufacturer.
2. The attachment of the Development Agreement is a Jeff question.
In order to mark any 2000 income, we will need to get CRRA to execute the Development Agreement in 2000.
In my opinion, we should show CRRA a copy of the LOI with the assumption that the Development Agreement is attached.
I would actually send them the draft Development Agreement a couple days after the LOI.
Based on how CRRA reacts, I would make an ultimate determination if the agreement needs to be attached to the LOI.
3. I expect at least one EPC contract per project.

The difficulty lies in the fact that the confirmation system reads the counterparty's name from Global Counterparty.
Since divisions of companies are not legal entities they do not have the power to contract in their own names.
If the correct legal name is not in Global Counterparty, the confirmation goes out with the wrong legal name on it seriously compromising the contract itself.
That is the source of Tana's concern regarding the correct entering of divisions in the system.
In this particular case since the counterparty is still not allowed to transact on EnronOnline almost a month after sending in their application they are understandably upset and are now complaining.
I would appreciate it if you could get this one fixed today and, if you have any problem with changing the GCP procedure, please let me know.

Please see the attached Interconnect Agreement with Questar.
I wanted you all to have a look at what we believe is the final draft.
It is a fairly standard, fully reimbursable interconnect with Questar.
Transwestern will own and operate the interconnect.
You will notice that Questar has requested a "Payment Plan" that details when they will pay Transwestern for the interconnect due to the recent Enron events.
If anyone has any questions or concerns about the timing of these payments, please give me a call.
Also, you will notice this interconnect may not be subject to the CIAC tax gross up, but to protect ourselves, we have added language in Para 3.2 that protects us financially if the IRS ever comes back to determine that this interconnect is subject to the CIAC tax.
Robert Guthrie with the tax department has worked with us to develop this language.
We hope to execute this Agreement this week.

"We believe the action we took addressed a severe concern,'' Robinson said.
"In our view, we did not believe we changed or made worse the financial situation.
We felt we made it better because it introduced a process for review and refund."
Jan Smutney-Jones, who was the ISO board chairman at the time and executive director of a group that represents power generators, said Winter did not consult him about eliminating the price cap.
Smutney-Jones also said he was unaware of anyone in the power-generating community being consulted.
"Terry did this by himself,'' said Smutney-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers.
"He did what he thought had to be done at the time to keep the power flowing."
The ISO board called an emergency meeting the next week demanding Winter explain his actions.
Some board members pushed to have Winter removed, but there were concerns such action would lead to more chaos, the governor's spokesman Maviglio said.
James J. Hoecker, the former Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chairman, defended making the December decision and also defended Winter.

Blue Planet: Who's afraid of Big Bad Wolf?
By Dan Whipple
UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL
Ever since he ate up Red Riding Hood's grandma and blew down the houses of two-thirds of the Three Little Pigs, the Big Bad Wolf has held a persistently bad reputation.
In part because of that reputation, the gray wolf was nearly exterminated from the lower 48 states by the 1920s, except for a small remnant population on Isle Royale National Park in Michigan's Lake Superior.
The last wolf was killed in Yellowstone National Park in 1943.
Western sheep and cattle ranchers, on whose behalf this extermination campaign was conducted, gratefully dusted their hands of the wolf and wrote him off as a job well done.
Their sheep could graze, their cows could ruminate and never a discouraging word would be heard.
After the major kill-offs, wolves outside of Alaska and Canada existed mostly as legend.
Like UFOs or Sasquatch, several people claimed to see fleeting lone wolves, usually in Yellowstone.

dead pixel of my photos?
just want to ask..i have an nikon dslr..im wondering why if i zoom my picture zoom like almost 200-300percent..i can see some dead pixel...is there something wrong with my camera body?
lens?
or what?
please help me..and what should i do to fix this problem?
or it is normal?
Are you sure it isn't dirt on the sensor?
Put the camera on manual focus and set focus to infinity
Take a photo of a very light plain subject close to the lens using long exposure and smallest aperture you have - over expose by a couple of stops
You will see in the image if there is dirt as that will be the only thing in focus

Dwarf Hamster Making Too Much Noise On Wheel at Night?
I'm getting a dwarf Hamster tomorrow And i was just talking to my Mom and she said that we have to take out the wheel at night because it would disturb her sleep But i told her no because i said their energetic at night at my room is right next door to hers But i heard their are wheels that dont make noise at all what would be the price of it?
I'm quite sure , you don't even have to buy another , all you need to do , is to pour some oil on the wheel , or even put some rubber on it's edges , the part that is making the noise .

Woud it be better if I got another filter and connected the other phone as well?
turn the modem off and see if the sound is still there... could be static on the line... if the sound is still there with the modem off then the problem is NOT the DSL....
if the trouble goes away with the modem off, then make sure that EVERYTHING EXCEPT the modem is filtered, this would include the alarm system, fax machine, satellite boxes, phones, etc...
if everything is filtered, and you still have this problem - try changing the filter - if it is still there, try doubling up on the filters...
You need either a filter for each device except the DSL modem, or a whole home filter which filters all the jacks, except the one which the DSL modem connects.
Best way to change 35mm film in Holga 120 whilst out and about?
I've modified my Holga 120 to take 35mm film and I know that you can't wind the film back, you have to open the back of the camera (in a darkroom) to rewind the film.
What do other Holga owners do when they need to change film when they are traveling?
Do you just take a changing bag with you?
Whats the easiest thing?

I have to scrub the floor 2-3 times a week now.
What could be the issue and can I try some home remedies first?
I love her and want to help her but I don't know when I'll be able to take her to to vet :( please help.
First of all, I am very sorry to hear you're having this issue with your cat. :(
Frequent urination is a sign of several things.
Bladder or Urinary tract infections are two common ones, but these usually are frequent visits, with small amounts of urine being passed.
If there is blood in the urine, or the cat seems to be in pain, then that is also a good indicator.
But your cat is passing a LOT of urine, and this is bad.
Given the chance your cat may only have one kidney, I would think the worst case scenario would be kidney disease, which untreated can lead to possible renal failure.
Signs of this can be hard to spot, and if this is true in her case she will definitely need to see a vet.

Good beer good service and what more could you want.

The salespeople are never available, the lines are always too long, and all the people want is a sale.
Incredibly rude and I will not return to it.

Nothing compares to a home made product that really stands the test of time. -

Rcommended by bees, too!
Highly recommended.

John was here in 45 minutes after I called on a 10 below zero early Sunday morning.

Boutique stores dealing in children's clothing/gifts are often outrageously priced (who wants to pay 40 dollars for a newborn onesie?)
but I was pleasantly surprised to find that the Purple Goose's prices are reasonable (for the SAME products found at other area boutiques, the prices were 20-25% cheaper).
The service was also excellent - friendly, helpful and informative without being overbearing.
Will definitely return.
Consistantly poor
A lack of organisation, coupled with the distain for its customers, makes this the worst rental agency I have used.
Chasing them on issues from the day I moved in (many of them still unresolved as I left) to all sorts of farcical issues with funds, after I left. . . . as soon as I could.
If you must use them, be vigilant and be ready to push, if you can go elsewhere then I would.

Extremely helpful and professional
As first-time home buyers, my husband and I found Stephanie Fairchild at Prudential Steamboat Realty, extremely helpful.
She worked with us for over a year, helping us find our perfect home.
Stephanie's knowledge of the market and properties in our price range, made us feel secure in our decision to buy when we did.
We would highly recommend Stephanie to anyone looking for a home in the Yampa Valley.
We appreciated her patience, knowledge and kindness!
Great Barber
Firstly, the other reviewer clearly has never been to Nick's, or he would know that Nick only charges $13 for a haircut which is pretty much industry standard.
I have been going to Nick for 5 months now precisely because he does pay attention to detail.

Only if it is of the quality of That's Amore.
The menu has the usual but then they step it up another notch.
The arancini di riso (risotto fritters) are not to be missed.
Chicken saltimboca was excellent and then there's the chocolate mousse that comes straight from heaven.
Pay extra attention to the appetizers - the next time I go there I'm planning on ordered a few instead of an entree.
Auto Towing is one of the best towing services I have used.

The kind of support they provide is simply great!!!

The first thing you notice when you arrive on location is that the waiting line literally goes out the door and spills into the parking lot.
A restaurant with this many patrons willing to stand in line just to order tacos must be good, right?
I mean, that's the way it works at amusement parks: the longest lines are at the best rides.
Well, this may be an exception.
The staff taking your order and "waiting" on you are very indifferent and have no sense of costumer service at all.
I have gotten better results talking to COMCAST customer service than with these folks.
And don't even think about asking to speak to the manager because this guy is, and pardon my French, a jerk.
If you have gotten through ordering, dealing with the rude staff and if you followed the dumb rules, you are finally presented with what you came for..some tacos that are "ok," but definitely not worth putting up with all the hassle.

Security in the hotel seemed to be excellent, but we were never given an explanation as to why someone would open these items.
When we called the front desk about an extremely boisterous crowd in the hall outside our door quite late at night, it seemed to take the hotel staff quite a while to quiet them down.
The staff was friendly, especially the front desk female supervisor, and seemed to want to help, but too many unusual things happened to make us want to stay there again.
Be Careful Of Who Your Sales Guy Is
I think this place is probably really great especially judging by the reviews on here.
My experience was awful though.
It ALL had to do with the sales guy which was a young 22 year old who had admittedly only been working for 2 weeks.
I was extremely interested in the car and very likely would have bought it, but the sales guy I dealt with ruined the deal.
Essentially, I told him I didn't trust him cause he was a car salesman, but he got so incredibly offended at that statement that he had to go cry to another salesman and compose himself before coming back.
I don't know if the kid had a bad day or what, but I had to sit and apologize about nothing for 10 minutes until he dropped the issue.

Security in the hotel seemed to be excellent, but we were never given an explanation as to why someone would open these items.
When we called the front desk about an extremely boisterous crowd in the hall outside our door quite late at night, it seemed to take the hotel staff quite a while to quiet them down.
The staff was friendly, especially the front desk female supervisor, and seemed to want to help, but too many unusual things happened to make us want to stay there again.
Be Careful Of Who Your Sales Guy Is I think this place is probably really great especially judging by the reviews on here.

The salatim salads are the smallest plates I've ever seen placed in front of me (you would most likely think they were condiments if it weren't explained to you).
Though they are mostly excellent, you generally don't get enough forkfuls to know if you really love them.
That being said, the laffa and hummus are out of this world.
Then again, for the three of us who dined together, two pieces of flatbread left us fighting for more, and licking the hummus from our fingers (and yes, those two pieces of flatbread did represent a three-person order).
Dinner was also an up-and-down experience.
The vegetarian dishes and lighter fare were almost always spot-on, while the lamb was often dry and/or overcooked.
The duck was a 65% glob of chewy fat with no resemblance to the juicy, crispy delicacy it usually represents at other establishments.
Dessert was... hmmm, that's interesting, I don't even remember dessert.
I guess that tells you a lot.
Oh, yes, the chocolate semifreddo was quite good.

In 2015, an initiative was started to set up a Dutch speaking DH+Lib community in the Netherlands and Belgium, based on the example of the American communal space of librarians, archivists, LIS graduate students, and information specialists to discuss topics ‘Where the Digital Humanities and Libraries meet’.
At the initial meeting it became apparent that most participants were there to learn more about digital humanities and were not (yet) in the situation where they were able to offer expertise on the subject.
On the administrative level, the directors of the libraries participating in the consortium of Dutch academic libraries (UKB) also expressed the wish that librarians become more fluent in DH.
A year later, the National Library of the Netherlands (Koninklijke Bibliotheek), and the University Library of the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam again concluded that librarians at their institutes who wanted to get involved in DH needed more training to adequately support researchers and students in this field.
Therefore both institutes joined forces to develop a set of clinics on DH for librarians.
The two institutes were later joined by the Leiden University Libraries.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. ELIZABETH B. PRELOGAR ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: COVID-19 is the most devastating pandemic in our nation's history and it has caused enormous disruption and economic distress.
Over the past three years, millions of Americans have struggled to pay rent, utilities, food, and many have been unable to pay their debts.
To head off immediate harm for student-loan borrowers, two secrataries across two administrations invoked the HEROES Act to suspend interest and payment obligations for all Americans with federally held loans.
So Secretary Cardona again invoked the HEROES Act to provide a measure of loan forgiveness to ensure that this unprecedented pandemic does not leave borrowers worse off in relation to their student loans.
The states ask this Court to deny that vital relief to millions of Americans, but they lack standing to seek that result.

I was thirteen.
It was spring, the barren time in March when you can not be sure if it is really warmer, but you are so desperate for change that you tell yourself the mud at the edge of the sidewalk is different from winter mud and you are sure that the smell of wet soil has suddenly a bit of the scent of summer rains, of grass and drowned earthworms.
And it has, because it is spring and inside the ground something is stirring.
I was wearing a yellow linen dress which my mother had picked out and which I therefore disliked although I knew it flattered me.
My shoes were white and I was concentrating on keeping them out of the mud.
My father and I were going to mass — my mother did not go; she was Protestant.
My father put his hand on top of my hair, his palm on my head, and I could feel the bone of my skull and my skin and his hot palm, so dry and strong.
When I was a little girl, he did that often, and called me Muscles.
He had not called me Muscles or put his hand on my head for a long time.

Salinity is one of the most important marine parameters, which controls many processes such as physical circulations, biogeochemistry dynamics from regional to global ocean [1,2].
Although drifters and buoys, together with cruises, have accumulated large amount in-situ water salinity data in different regions, it is still difficult to monitor global ocean salinity with high temporal-spatial resolution by the in situ measurements.
The early concept of remote sensing of SSS has been demonstrated in the late 1970s with observations by Skylab [7] and two airborne L-band radiometry experiments [8,9].
At the end of 1990, two airborne microwave interferometers, the electronically scanned thinned array radiometer (ESTAR) and the scanning low-frequency microwave radiometer (SLFMR), successfully produced SSS maps in coastal areas in agreement with in-situ measurements with an accuracy of about 1 psu.
However, the sensitivity of satellite measured brightness temperature to SSS is quite low.

In 1968, he published his theory of Case Grammar (Fillmore 1968), which highlighted the fact that syntactic structure can be predicted by semantic participants.
An action can have an agent, a patient, purposes, locations, and so on.
These participants were called "cases" in his original paper, but later came to be known as semantic roles or thematic relations, which are similar to theta roles in generative grammar.
Following his move to the University of California, Berkeley, in 1971, this theory eventually evolved into a broader cognitive linguistic theory called Frame Semantics (1976).
A commercial event, for instance, crucially involved elements such as a seller, a buyer, some good, and some money.
In language, such an event can be expressed in a variety of different ways, e.g. using the verb 'to sell' or the verb 'to buy'.
According to frame semantics, meaning is best studied in terms of the mental concepts and participants in the minds of the speaker and addressee.
Around the same time, Fillmore's Santa Cruz Lectures on Deixis, delivered in 1971 and published in 1975, contributed to establishing the field of linguistic pragmatics, which studies the relationship between linguistic form and the context of utterance. [7] [8]
In all of this research, he illuminated the fundamental importance of semantics, and its role in motivating syntactic and morphological phenomena.
His collaboration with Paul Kay and George Lakoff was generalized into the theory of Construction Grammar.

In 1968, he published his theory of Case Grammar (Fillmore 1968), which highlighted the fact that syntactic structure can be predicted by semantic participants.
An action can have an agent, a patient, purposes, locations, and so on.
These participants were called "cases" in his original paper, but later came to be known as semantic roles or thematic relations, which are similar to theta roles in generative grammar.
Following his move to the University of California, Berkeley, in 1971, this theory eventually evolved into a broader cognitive linguistic theory called Frame Semantics (1976).
A commercial event, for instance, crucially involved elements such as a seller, a buyer, some good, and some money.
In language, such an event can be expressed in a variety of different ways, e.g. using the verb 'to sell' or the verb 'to buy'.
According to frame semantics, meaning is best studied in terms of the mental concepts and participants in the minds of the speaker and addressee.
Around the same time, Fillmore's Santa Cruz Lectures on Deixis, delivered in 1971 and published in 1975, contributed to establishing the field of linguistic pragmatics, which studies the relationship between linguistic form and the context of utterance.
[7] [8] In all of this research, he illuminated the fundamental importance of semantics, and its role in motivating syntactic and morphological phenomena.
His collaboration with Paul Kay and George Lakoff was generalized into the theory of Construction Grammar.

Gordon assumed the additional Christian name of Leopold when confirmed as a Roman Catholic shortly before his death.
Life
Gordon was brought up and remained a lifelong Roman Catholic, at a time when the Church was being persecuted in Scotland, which had become Calvinist.
After an education at the parish schools of Cruden and Ellon, at age of fifteen he entered the Jesuit college at Braunsberg, East Prussia, then part of Poland; however, his character did not tolerate well the strict and sombre way of life at the school, and he soon decided to return home.
In the course of the next five years he served alternately for Poland and Sweden and was taken prisoner by both.
At the Battle of Chudnov in 1660, Gordon was wounded. [1]
Upon hearing of the Stuart restoration, Gordon left the Polish service, but found himself unable to obtain military employment in Scotland or England. [1]
In 1661, after further experiences as a soldier of fortune, he joined the Russian army under Tsar Aleksei I, and in 1665 was sent on a special mission to England.
After his return he distinguished himself in several wars against the Turks and Tatars in southern Russia.
Gordon disliked the Russian service, complaining of the corruption and venality of Russian officials, which left him, in his own words, "almost at wits end with vexation". [2]

The death of Petronios later that year would leave Apa Horsiesios in charge, and the popular Theodorus would retreat to the distant monastery of Phnoum.
Although it seems Theodorus practiced complete submission to the new leader of the Koinonia, problems soon arose in several Pachomian monasteries that viewed Horsiesios as a weak leader.
Refusing to work or communicate and demanding a new leader, many of the elder monks completely abandoned any notion of obedience to Horsiesios.
The federation of monasteries was falling apart, and Theodorus rushed to Tabennese to placate the rebels.
Soon after his arrival, Theodorus was the new de facto leader, though he claimed to be only acting on behalf of Horsiesios.
For eighteen years Theodorus administered from Pachomius’ old headquarters in Phbow, using techniques far more assertive than his predecessors, such as constantly shuffling the offices and locations of the most ambitious monks.
Yet in spite of this somewhat unstable shifting, the Koinonia was ruled peacefully for nearly two decades, at which point Theodorus predicted he would soon die.
Within a few months his prediction came true, and Apa Horsiesios once more took his place as the head of the communities in both title and authority. [1]
Cool.
Alright folks.

The Further Vision
“I have already told you of the sickness and confusion that comes with time travelling.
And this time I was not seated properly in the saddle, but sideways and in an unstable fashion.
For an indefinite time I clung to the machine as it swayed and vibrated, quite unheeding how I went, and when I brought myself to look at the dials again I was amazed to find where I had arrived.

Once Bet was asleep it was impossible to wake her up.
I fell asleep thinking about how I wished that the Scathalos outrunners were gone.
I dreamed that I was at the offworlder's home, where it was summer but no one was taking care of the stabros, and they were all glad, and so I was a hero - and I was startled awake by gunfire.
Just more drinking and shooting.
I wished my da would come home.
It didn't seem fair that we should lie here and be afraid while the men were getting drunk and singing.

We mixed different concentrations of ROS with the spores, plated them out on petridishes with an agar-solution where fungus can grow on.
A day after, we counted how many spores were still alive.
How reliable do you consider your results to be?
The results we got are very reliable.
We had a lot of colonies containing a lot of ants, and wherever possible we conducted the experiment blind.
This means the experimenter doesn't know which ants belong to which treatment, so it's impossible to influence the results with 'observer bias'.
However, of course this is proof in just one species.
It is hard to extrapolate to other ants, as different species lead very different lives.

I investigated this possibility carefully and found the unanimous feeling that legislation to give flat cash grants could never pass the Congress.
I could have introduced a bill to provide grants even though it could not have passed, but I feel very strongly that to have done this would have simply raised false hopes where real help is what is needed.
For this reason I decided to introduce legislation that would lower interest rates on rebuilding loans and provide that a major portion of these loans would not have to be repaid.
Very frankly, winning passage of the entire package of flood relief bills I have sponsored will be an extremely difficult task.
On the other hand, when these bills were introduced most Congressmen felt that no new legislation could be passed.
As of today, the House has passed one of my bills, and prospects for at least some helpful new legislation are good.
Because it is important that people affected by the flood disaster know exactly what new laws have been proposed, how these would affect them, and what the chances for getting these new laws really is, I would like to give you a hard, realistic appraisal of what we are trying to do, and how likely it is that we will succeed.

SBA loans are presently available to businessmen and homeowners affected by the flood.
They are given at 5 1/8% interest.

Then around November Ruth had to move to a single because of bad grades- that's one thing about this room, it can really hurt your grades - she moved upstairs to the 3rd floor, where there are 3 singles so the four-room became a 3 room for a while, until January, when the 3rd floor was condemned by some shitty building inspector.

We've all existed so far but we've been damn lucky, and have also worked damned hard.

First of all don't talk back to Mrs. G. and you'll have a good year.
Adele, the maid, is so dumb that you'll have loads of fun just giving her gas.

Teams from different countries were arranged in groups of three, and groups faced off in pairs.
The group whose three robots collectively earned the most points won that match.
According to the Afghan team's coach, Alireza Mehraban, in their first matchup, the Afghan team's robot, named "Better Idea of Afghan Girls," scored one or two points for the three-nation alliance with the Gabonese and Estonian teams.
This year, the European team won the competition overall, with the silver medal going to Poland and the bronze to Armenia.

We were so interested because we hadn't long or enough time to get ready for competition but we came to United States and now we are here because of Trump intervention."
The team arrived in Washington D.C. after many difficulties.
They were twice denied visas to enter the United States.
Even applying for a visa required the entire team to travel about 500 miles (800 km) from Herat, their home, to the capital in Kabul, through territory controlled by the Taliban.
They made the trip twice and were turned down both times.

New Zealand begins process to consider changing national flag design
Thursday, May 7, 2015
On Tuesday, the New Zealand government announced the start of a public process to suggest designs for a new national flag, and determine whether their citizens would prefer a different national flag over the current one.
The current flag of New Zealand.
The current New Zealand flag is partially based on the United Kingdom's flag;
the new one would be unique to New Zealand.
The government's Flag Consideration Project has planned a number of conferences and roadshows as part of this process, with the first meeting set to take place in Christchurch on May 16.
According to the New Zealand Herald, Emeritus Professor John Burrows, the chairman of the project's panel of twelve, said New Zealand's flag has never before been open to public choice.

Lantern Festival in Taipei lights up the night
Monday, March 5, 2007
Taipei, Taiwan — The Taipei City Lantern Festival was off to a bright start on Saturday Night as hundreds of thousands of people crowded onto the Chiang Kai Shek Memorial near downtown Taipei to witness city mayor Hau Lung-bin and other dignitaries ceremoniously flip the switch to light hundreds of colorful lantern scenes in and around the 240,000 square meter memorial park.
The centerpiece of this rock concert-like performance is a 15 meter high rotating pig equipped with a fog machine, laser light show and theme music.
The theme of this years lantern festival revolves around the 12 year Chinese zodiac cycles year of the pig.
Its round shape symbolizes wealth and good fortune and is believed to bring good luck.
Started in 1990, the Taipei lantern festival continues a 2000 year old tradition of light related festivals marking the end of the Chinese New Year celebrations.
This particular event grows in popularity every year.

The scientists found reduction of crop yields by 2050 exceeded 10% of 2000 levels, substantially decreasing food security, in all cases examined.
Several scenarios were considered because of uncertainty of future levels of ozone pollution.
They estimated by 2050, increasing population and changing diet would increase world food needs by 50 percent.
As coauthor Colette Heald told The Huffington Post, "The climate projections are quite consistent [...]
the future of ozone pollution is very different [...] leading to either offsetting or reinforcing effects [of climate change] on crops".
By 2050, undernourishment would increase by either 49 percent or by 27 percent, depending on the scenario.
The study focuses on ozone-temperature covariation: ground-level ozone increases with temperatures.
Heald said although temperature and ozone are separately known to impact crop yields, "nobody has looked at these together".
Depending on region and crops, the yields may be primarily sensitive to ozone - in the case of wheat - or heat - in the case of maize - alone, providing a local estimation of relative benefits of climate change adaptation versus ozone regulation.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture notes, "Ground-level ozone causes more damage to plants than all other air pollutants combined", highlighting the importance of air quality for agriculture.

Somehow we’ve weathered and witnessed a nation that isn’t broken but simply unfinished
The hope she spoke about—the strong and happy hope— the hope we feel today, is a hope, of course, that is tempered by reality.
This was an inauguration unlike most others.
The crowds that customarily line the National Mall were absent, a reminder that our Nation is still in the throes of a deadly pandemic.
The presence of thousands of National Guardsmen, police, and Secret Service was a reminder that 2 weeks ago, in this very room and on those very steps where President Biden took the oath, a mob of violent criminals tried to dismantle our democracy—our sacred democracy—brick by brick and would try again if they could.
But, as President Biden said a few hours ago, today, democracy has prevailed, the will of the people was heeded, and the peaceful transfer of power fulfilled.
It takes a lot more than a band of hooligans to bring our grand democracy down.
Let it be a message to our friends and adversaries around the world that our democracy, though it has been tried and been tested, shall long endure.
And let it be a message to those terrorists who desecrated this temple of democracy that they will never prevail.

If someone on a date takes their companion’s hand and gives a cute little wink, the person may have reason to hope the winker is not just joking around.
American cultural anthropologist Clifford Geertz (1973) used the example of winking to illustrate two important aspects of culture.
First, culture is learned.
Innate human behaviors—that is, behaviors that people are born with—are biological, not cultural.
Blinking is biological.
Acquired human behaviors—that is, behaviors that people are taught—are cultural.
Winking is cultural.
This means that cultural behaviors are not genetically inherited from generation to generation but must be passed down from older members of a society to younger members.
This process, as you’ll recall from What is Anthropology? is called enculturation.
Some aspects of enculturation are deliberate and systematic, such as learning the rules of written punctuation in a language.

The impact of evolutionary ethics on epistemological questions depends on these deeper questions about epistemology. [13]
Evolutionary explanations of morality, however, provide us with a useful starting point for thinking about these questions.
See Klenk (2019).
CONCLUSION
Evolutionary ethics has helped us to get a much clearer sense of where the human moral sense is coming from.
While this is a far cry from revealing to us what we ought to do, the research program seems full of promise nonetheless.
Once we get into the details, we can see that it also raises deep theoretical questions about evolutionary explanations, the relation of descriptive and normative claims, the epistemology of justification and truth, and the general viability of naturalism in ethics.
Much left to wonder, then, but with some ideas about where to get our answers.

THE MAYA
After the decline of the Olmec, a city rose in the fertile central highlands of Mesoamerica.
The ethnicity of this settlement’s inhabitants is debated; some scholars believe it was a multiethnic city.
Large-scale agriculture and the resultant abundance of food allowed time for people to develop special trades and skills other than farming.
Builders constructed over twenty-two hundred apartment compounds for multiple families, as well as more than a hundred temples.
Among these were the Pyramid of the Sun (which is two hundred feet high) and the Pyramid of the Moon (one hundred and fifty feet high).
Near the Temple of the Feathered Serpent, graves have been uncovered that suggest humans were sacrificed for religious purposes.
The city was also the center for trade, which extended to settlements on Mesoamerica’s Gulf Coast.
The Maya were one Mesoamerican culture that had strong ties to Teotihuacan.
The Maya’s architectural and mathematical contributions were significant.

To show what Einstein’s insight really means, let’s first consider how we locate an event in space and time.
For example, imagine you have to describe to worried school officials the fire that broke out in your room when your roommate tried cooking shish kebabs in the fireplace.
You explain that your dorm is at 6400 College Avenue, a street that runs in the left-right direction on a map of your town; you are on the fifth floor, which tells where you are in the up-down direction; and you are the sixth room back from the elevator, which tells where you are in the forward-backward direction.
Then you explain that the fire broke out at 6:23 p.m. (but was soon brought under control), which specifies the event in time.
Any event in the universe, whether nearby or far away, can be pinpointed using the three dimensions of space and the one dimension of time.
Newton considered space and time to be completely independent, and that continued to be the accepted view until the beginning of the twentieth century.
But Einstein showed that there is an intimate connection between space and time, and that only by considering the two together—in what we call spacetime—can we build up a correct picture of the physical world.
We examine spacetime a bit more closely in the next subsection.
The gist of Einstein’s general theory is that the presence of matter curves or warps the fabric of spacetime.

Cleveland from lakefront.
Cleveland is the urban center of Northeast Ohio, the 15th largest combined metropolitan area in the United States.
Throughout the twentieth century, the City of Cleveland proper was ranked as one of the 10 largest cities in the U.S. (from 1890 until 1970 per US Census Bureau statistics).
Like most U.S. cities, Cleveland proper began to lose population to suburban areas in the 1960s and 1970s.
As its "comeback" has continued, the official moniker is now the New American City as Cleveland has rightfully earned the reputation as a model of effective public-private partnership for urban planning.
Despite the common perception that Cleveland is an industrial town, just beyond the automotive and steel plants, a clean and beautiful downtown rises at the mouth of the Cuyahoga River on the southern shore of Lake Erie (often marvelled over by visitors who are surprised you can't see the other side, i.e., Canada).
Like other cities in the so-called "rust belt“, Cleveland has endured growing pains as it makes its transition from a manufacturing-based economy.
While Cleveland continues to play a leading role in building the U.S. industrial base, it has also developed economic prowess in the fields of health care, law, finance, insurance, real estate development, and professional services.

How to Pack Your Possessions When Moving
Even if you can't wait to live in your new house, curb your enthusiasm and resist the urge to cram all your possessions any which way into boxes.
Steps
Pack one room at a time if possible, and start with items that are least often used.
Write down a list of everything you are packing, in particular if it's valuable.
Books, CDs, expensive clothes.
Also, take note of which item is in which box.
Use sturdy boxes.
Fill the box to the brim and seal the lid.

If you don't mind mixed flavors, you can just skip this step altogether.
Add six Skittles to 25 ml of vodka.
Keep swirling the mixture until the Skittles are almost completely dissolved.
Note that the ratio of Skittles to vodka varies from recipe to recipe.
You should experiment to find your preferred mix before making larger bottles.
Filter out the remaining Skittle "insides".

Displaying XML data
XML syntax (the tags and their placement in a document) defines and describes the data in an XML document but doesn't indicate how the data should be displayed.
In earlier applications and in some current uses, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) were used to tell the browser how to display the XML data.
However, a CSS isn't always a good choice because they are written in a specialized language which means that the developer has to use another language in order to write, modify, or understand the structure of the style sheet.
A CSS merely allows you to specify the formatting of each XML element without much control over the output.
On the other hand, an Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL) style sheet is considerably more flexible than a CSS file.
It allows you to precisely select the data that will be displayed, to specify the order or arrangement of the data, and to modify or add information.
You can apply a filter to a row or column field to show the top or bottom n items based on a total.
For example, you can filter for the top or bottom 25 % of salespeople based on the number of orders handled.

Sir Reginald Harvey was president of the consortium of the three mining concessionaire companies, and it was common knowledge that, as a personal friend of Redvers Ledley, the most unpopular governor the territory had ever had, he had influenced the governor to outlaw the miners' union at a time when Mweta and Shinza were using it to promote the independence movement.
There was a famous newspaper interview where he had called Mweta that golliwog from Gala, raising its unruly and misguided head in the nursery of industrial relations in this young country.
It's enough to make your hair stand on end, said Dando; and enjoyed the effect.
The People's Independence Party, at the time, had taken Harvey's remark as an insulting reference to Mweta's hair; he still had it all, and it certainly would be in evidence on Tuesday.
Bray repeated what had been said to him at the airport that morning – that some of the white people still living in the capital would be more at home down South, in Rhodesia or South Africa.
Ras Asahe meant the whites –
all know that after the end of the year they'll be on contract, and that means they'll be replaced in three years.

In his right hand, fixed between his thumb and first two fingers, he held an uncapped fountain pen, still poised in a writing position.
The man seemed surprised to find a stranger standing before him.

It was noted that some countries showed a low level of participation, among them some of the euro area countries.
This situation may reflect organisational rather than structural situations and an effort to balance it is currently under way.
Some countries are more active in organising events, with Italy representing over 21% of the total number of activities.
As of 2005, the new Member States became active in organising Pericles actions.
As the evaluation report also mentions (p. 14) that the organisation of Pericles actions covered all the areas relevant to the protection of the euro:
law enforcement, judicial, financial and technical and promoted particularly the creation of networks useful for achieving greater efficiency in the fight against the crime of counterfeiting.
Contributions at the Pericles actions are ensured by the ECB, the Commission, Europol and, in some cases, Eurojust, Interpol and the US Secret Service.
With regard to the aspects of euro protection, where the responsibility belongs to the Member States, expertise was systematically sought in their specialised services.
The Pericles actions take place mostly inside the EU.
However, a number of actions have been organised in third or candidate countries, reflecting the specific needs to protect the euro.

Inward FDI could increase by as much as 83% annually by 2020;
in the pharmaceutical industry alone, FDI could reach as much as $77 billion, with R&D rising to $4.2 billion and 44,000 new jobs being created.
The Indian government's ongoing assault on pharmaceutical IP makes these findings even more significant.
Over the last two years, India has invalidated or otherwise attacked patents on 15 drugs produced by international firms in order to make way for local champions, claiming that exclusivity enables companies to charge high prices that harm consumers.
But drug patents and prices are not the main – or even a major – obstacle to patients' access to medical care in India.
The bigger issue, as the IMS consultancy found last year, is the shortage of doctors, clinics, and hospitals, especially in rural areas.
Even the public clinics and hospitals that do exist are often rendered useless by high rates of absenteeism by doctors.
Furthermore, Indians lack access to insurance programs, particularly for outpatient care.
Far from improving citizens' access to health care, weak IP protections are exacerbating India's formidable health-care challenges.
It is equally important for trade negotiators worldwide to reject the notion that IP protection is a luxury that only rich countries can afford.

Soon afterwards, around the time of his father's death, Balzac wrote El Verdugo - about a 30-year-old man who kills his father (Balzac was 30 years old at the time).
This was the first work signed "Honoré De Balzac".
Like his father, he added the aristocratic-sounding particle to help him fit into respected society, but it was a choice based on skill, not birthright.
"The aristocracy and authority of talent are more substantial than the aristocracy of names and material power", he wrote in 1830.
The timing of the decision was also significant;
"The disappearance of the father coincides with the adoption of the nobiliary particle.
"Just as his father had worked his way up from poverty into respectable society, Balzac considered toil and effort his real mark of nobility.
When the July Revolution overthrew Charles X in 1830, Balzac declared himself a Legitimist, supporting Charles' House of Bourbon - but with qualifications.
He felt that the new July Monarchy (which claimed widespread popular support) was disorganized and unprincipled, in need of a mediator to keep the political peace between the King and insurgent forces.
But after a near-fatal accident in 1832 (he slipped and his head on the street), Balzac decided not to stand for election.

"His labyrinthine city provided a literary model used later by English novelist Charles Dickens and Russian author Fyodor Dostoevsky.
The centrality of Paris in La Comédie Humaine is key to Balzac's legacy as a realist.
"Realism is nothing if not urban", notes critic Peter Brooks;
the scene of a young man coming into the city to find his fortune is ubiquitous in the realist novel, and appears repeatedly in Balzac's works, such as Illusions Perdues.
Balzac's literary mood evolved over time from one of despondency and chagrin to one of solidarity and courage - but not optimism.
La Peau De Chagrin, among his earliest novels, is a pessimistic tale of confusion and destruction.
But the cynicism declined as his oeuvre progressed, and the characters of Illusions Perdues reveal sympathy for those who are pushed to one side by society.
Balzac concerned himself overwhelmingly with the darker essence of human nature and the corrupting influence of middle and high societies.
He worked to observe humanity in its most representative state, frequently passing incognito among the masses of Parisian society to do research.
He used incidents from his life and the people around him, in works like Eugénie Grandet and Louis Lambert.

Shakespeare divided his time between London and Stratford during his career.
He moved across the river to Southwark by 1599, the year his company constructed the Globe Theatre there.
Rowe was the first biographer to record the tradition, repeated by Johnson, that Shakespeare retired to Stratford 'some years before his death'.
He was still working as an actor in London in 1608;
in an answer to the sharers' petition in 1635 Cuthbert Burbage stated that after purchasing the lease of the Blackfriars Theatre in 1608 from Henry Evans, the King's Men 'placed men players' there, 'which were Heminges, Condell, Shakespeare, etc.'.
In a document dated 7 June 1609 in a lawsuit he brought in Stratford against John Addenbrooke, Shakespeare is described as 'generosus nuper in curia domini Jacobi' ('gentleman, recently at the Court of King James').
However it is perhaps relevant that the bubonic plague raged in London throughout 1609.
The London public playhouses were repeatedly closed during extended outbreaks of the plague (a total of over 60 months closure between May 1603 and February 1610), which meant there was often no acting work.
Retirement from all work was uncommon at that time.
Shakespeare continued to visit London during the years 1611–1614.

The poetry depends on extended, sometimes elaborate metaphors and conceits, and the language is often rhetorical — written for actors to declaim rather than speak.
The grand speeches in Titus Andronicus, in the view of some critics, often hold up the action, for example;
and the verse in The Two Gentlemen of Verona has been described as stilted.
Soon, however, Shakespeare began to adapt the traditional styles to his own purposes.
The opening soliloquy of Richard III has its roots in the self-declaration of Vice in medieval drama.
At the same time, Richard's vivid self-awareness looks forward to the soliloquies of Shakespeare's mature plays.
No single play marks a change from the traditional to the freer style.
Shakespeare combined the two throughout his career, with Romeo and Juliet perhaps the best example of the mixing of the styles.
He increasingly tuned his metaphors and images to the needs of the drama itself.
Shakespeare's standard poetic form was blank verse, composed in iambic pentameter.

usually, these are just a chance for the suckups to suck up, but this time people are actually concerned about the company's plans.
they work on wall street, after all, so when they hear a company who's stated goals include "don't be evil," they imagine a company who's eventually history will be "don't be profitable."
it's not quite as freewheeling an environment as you'd imagine: sergey brin has actually created a mathematical 'proof' that the company's self-driven research strategy, which gives employees one day a week to do research projects on their own, is a good, respectable idea .
read the entire article; there's a punchline, too.
my opinion piece on the implications of arafat's passing for al-qaeda has appeared at newsday.
excerpt:
"arafat's secular nationalism was supple enough to compromise with israel and to imagine a two-state solution, even if the road of negotiations remained rocky.
the continued israeli colonization of the occupied palestinian territories during the 1990s helped, along with terrorist attacks by radical groups such as hamas, to derail the peace process, which sharon had always opposed.
arafat's death creates a vacuum in palestinian leadership that will not soon be filled.
sharon's assassination of major hamas leaders has also weakened authority structures in that party.

although musharraf did turn against the taliban after september 11, under extreme duress from the us, elements of his military continued to support radical islamism and have recently been implicated in assassination attempts on musharraf himself.
this was the body that bush proclaimed was bringing "stability" to the region in fall of 1999.
so, one answer to bush's charge about edwards is that if it had any merit, bush should have declined to run himself.
another answer is that edwards certainly knows far more about foreign affairs now than bush did then.
indeed, given how bush has rampaged around the world alienating allies and ignoring vital conflicts with the potential to blow back on the us, one might well argue that edwards knows more now than bush does.
this is what edwards' campaign literature said about his positions: "edwards believes that the u.s. must be an active leader to help resolve conflicts, from reducing tensions between india and pakistan to the peace process in northern ireland.
edwards is a strong supporter of israel, and believes that the u.s. has a vital role in promoting peace between the israelis and the palestinians."
i don't see bush doing any of this.

for the past 25 years landlocked afghanistan has suffered from constant interference from its neighbours - pakistan, iran and the central asian republics - and regional powers -russia and india.
the neighbours are still interfering, but there are signs that rather than undermining afghanistan's stability they may now be trying to strengthen it.
"the elections should be a reassurance to all our neighbours that a stable afghanistan, a peaceful afghanistan is good for all.
nobody should feel a looser in afghanistan,'' president hamid karzai told pakistan's english daily the nation.

whether he was actually awol during this stint is unclear.

this little-noted interview with blount's nephew murph archibald, which appeared on national public radio's "all things considered on march 30, 2004, gives a devastating insight into what it was like to have to suffer through bush in that period.
"all things considered (8:00 pm et) - npr march 30, 2004 tuesday
this campaign season, there have been questions about whether george w. bush fulfilled his obligations to the national guard as a young lieutenant in the early 1970s.
for weeks, reporters scoured alabama in search of pilots or anyone who might have remembered seeing mr. bush at the time he was serving in the national guard there.
there is one place in alabama where mr. bush was present nearly every day: the headquarters in montgomery of us senate candidate winton "red" blount.
president bush has always said that working for blount was the reason he transferred to the alabama air national guard.

if you need more, there is a proposal from the documentation committee for a new alternative for calculating termination amounts (we heard about it in amsterdam) that i think will be particularly attractive to the energy markets.
i don't know where this stands officially (i haven't heard any developments since amsterdam) but i can find out from bob pickle if you want.

i might also add a few items about international developments and the eei physical power trading form.

dear justin
marly asked me to respond to you.
as you know, the suffix online is purely descriptive and now used by many companies.
therefore, any trade mark registration that incorporates the word online as a suffix in the way that you use it will not enable its owner to prevent others from using the word online.
given the above, if you have adequate protection for the word enron (which covers the services that you offer on-line as well as your core activities), i'd say that another application for the words enron online is probably unnecessary.
however, if you use a particular logo for the on-line service, that should be registered.
i hope the above is clear.

if sam's description below of the gcp procedure is correct, it looks to me like something needs to be changed.
the difficulty lies in the fact that the confirmation system reads the counterparty's name from global counterparty.
since divisions of companies are not legal entities they do not have the power to contract in their own names.
if the correct legal name is not in global counterparty, the confirmation goes out with the wrong legal name on it seriously compromising the contract itself.
that is the source of tana's concern regarding the correct entering of divisions in the system.
in this particular case since the counterparty is still not allowed to transact on enrononline almost a month after sending in their application they are understandably upset and are now complaining.
i would appreciate it if you could get this one fixed today and, if you have any problem with changing the gcp procedure, please let me know.

we are looking at putting the metering facilities on their row (also, i think we will have to purchase about 50ft of row from elpaso to get to questar's property).
as you look at this, if for some reason we cannot obtain elpaso row, we will have to look at plan b which would be to put the metering on our row.
our in-service date is may 1.
if you think that may 1 may be difficult due to receiving the parts/materials on a timely basis because of the issues that vendors may have with us because of recent enron events, please let me know.
questar has already informed us that they would help obtain parts/materials to our specifications if it helps achieve an in-service date of may 1.
thanks,
kim.
listening to the edison call w/investors edison says they will pay everyone at the same time ("big bang" approach) sometime in q1'02.

we can grow in our capacity to be human - to be loving - in a family unit.

throughout history, tyrants have known that by denying the right of oppressed peoples to form and nurture families, they can kill the spirit of those peoples.

the american laws forbidding interracial marriage, now struck down, were clearly discriminatory.
denial of the status of marriage to those who would freely accept its responsibilities creates legal and economic inequities and social injustice.

i didn't expect to react that way, but when i was looking around my workplace in nashua, new hampshire, and everyone else looked pretty much like me, it was really very eerie.

why is it stil doing this even though i don't have the other phone connected?
woud it be better if i got another filter and connected the other phone as well?
turn the modem off and see if the sound is still there... could be static on the line... if the sound is still there with the modem off then the problem is not the dsl....
if the trouble goes away with the modem off, then make sure that everything except the modem is filtered, this would include the alarm system, fax machine, satellite boxes, phones, etc...
you need either a filter for each device except the dsl modem, or a whole home filter which filters all the jacks, except the one which the dsl modem connects.

well, t.v. is a series of flickering pictures that are streamed together to make a moving picture.

to a dog, watching t.v. is a lot like watching and old scratchy silent film because their flicker fusion seems to occur at a rate of 70 to 80hz.
so they see the pictures flicker slower and there for it seems choppy to them.
so chances are that if your dog likes to watch t.v., it's probably because of the sounds.
hearing is a dog's secondary sense, and i will discuss that in another blog entery.

if you have a good repoire (which i'm sure you do) with them, they should be honest on if this horse is fixable to any degree... not really sure what you want to do with him...
even if you can figure out what is wrong with this poor poneh, there is always the chance for remission and then relapse so you may have to do deal with again in the future.
so all in all, put the money up front before taking on this horse.
a few hundred out of pocket now will possibly save you thousands once the horse is in your name.
could he have had a blow to the head causing this atrophy?
or a difficult birth?
was it always like this?
or has it occurred since birth.

if you cannot park in the lot, then you can park in the shopping center's garage, and walk up to endo sushi.
the service is fast.
be sure to ring the little bell on your way out if you enjoyed your meal!
horrible service!
i got yelled at, literally yelled at because i asked if i could pick up my car 5-10 minutes late.
i explained that i was already on my way and i would rush to get there as soon as i could because i needed my car for work at 5am, but the guy was arguing with me saying he was gonna lock the doors right at 5:30.

disatisfied customer, i went through kitchen aid and used one of their recommended vendors.
a&e came out, charged $129 fee just to walk in the door.
i needed a part for my appliance, the cost was very high so i said never mind, paid the fee and called a local business for a second quote.
the second vendor charged $55 (less than half of what a&e charges) to come and applied that to the price of the repair service (which a&e does not).
their quote came in at half the price of a&e for the same work and same part.
seems to me like a&e charges way more than necessary!

i spent $2300 on the bedroom suite, which was complete and excellent condition on the showroom floor.
upon delivery it was clear the entire set was damaged: a piece of wood was broke on the headboard; the chest of drawers was missing all four pieces necessary to attach the legs; the dresser back legs were pushed in causing the dresser to lean into the wall; and a nighstand was missing a drawer.
how do you lose a drawer.
after complaining on september 10th to national home furnishings, boyles, the hickory furniture mart and home delivery service the latter finally called me back and said they would be up to pick the dresser and chest of drawers at some future point and at some later point it would be professional repaired and at some later point it would be returned.
the customer service at home delivery service was terrible let alone their promise to proper set up furniture.
so i am in limbo regarding a bedroom suite.
i hope the owners and employees of this store have broken bedroom suites in their homes and furniture sitting in someone's warehouse.
maybe then they will begin to understand poor customer service and terrible sit up service.

proof
the proof proceeds by the principle of mathematical induction on the number of vertices.
for all n ∈ n>0, let p (n) be the proposition: gn can be assigned a proper vertex k - coloring such that k ≤ 5.
basis for the induction
p (r) is trivially true for 1 ≤ r ≤ 5, as there are no more than 5 vertices to be colored.
this is our basis for the induction.

in order to design this curriculum we follow a four step approach with a working out loud-principle (williams, 2010):
desk research about what being a dh librarian entails (e.g. hartsell-gundy et al., 2015; mulligan, 2016; also see the zotero library of the liber digital humanities working group);
identify possible subjects, based on experience, a comparison of existing teaching material related to dh (e.g. the programming historian, the digital scholarship training programme at the british library and columbia university's developing librarian project) and the tadirah taxonomy of research activities;
get feedback from researchers on possible subjects, based on the knowledge and skills they feel librarians need;
get feedback from librarians on possible subjects, based on already known gaps in their knowledge and skills.
with these in hand, we will design the curriculum of clinics, based on the method of 'constructive alignment' (biggs et al., 2011), to make sure that the intended learning objectives and the teaching/learning activities stay aligned.
our plan is to organize a maximum of 6 clinics, each one full day.
each day starts with one or more lectures by researchers, that address the conceptual knowledge needed.
the afternoon sessions will be devoted to the hands-on training of skills, following the library carpentry model as closely as possible.
by having researchers provide the lecture sessions, we hope to fuel the enthusiasm of the librarians with the inspiration of direct contact with researchers and to provide access to a network within and across universities.

aside from the excellent transportation infrastructure that was completed in time for the 2004 olympics (from new freeways to light rail systems), the city's historic center underwent serious renovation.
most notable among the city's facelift projects are the unification of archaeological sites - which connects the city's classical - era ruins and monuments to each other through a network of pleasant pedestrianized streets - and the restoration of the picturesque neoclassical thissio and plaka districts.
the ancient olympic games took place in olympia from 776 bce to 394 ad.
it is a lengthy day trip from athens to visit olympia, but quite interesting.
architecture
athens was just a small provincial village when it was chosen in the 1830s to serve as the national capital of the modern greek state.
although it had a prestigious past, the city's political, economic, and cultural importance had declined over the centuries, leaving behind only its classical ruins as a reminder of better times.
with the decision to move the national capital from nafplio to athens, architects and city planners were hired to build a new city next to the classical ruins, with grand neoclassical homes and public buildings, large city squares, green spaces, and wide avenues, making a conscious, decisive turn from the city's ottoman past.
the city regained its importance in greek civilization, and by 1900 had evolved into a very attractive cosmopolitan city, with abundant neoclassical architecture harking to the nation's past.
the 20th century however, marked the rapid development of athens.

this is important, because as we will show in § 6 below, some of the eegimaa death prevention names and child-bearing names are given to eegimaa people from other communities.
eegimaa is a joola language spoken in the basse casamance area of southern senegal by a population estimated to be between 7,000 (bassene, 2007) and 11,200 speakers (lewis, simons, & fennig, 2014).
joola languages are classified as members of sapir's (1971) bak group of atlantic languages of the niger congo language phylum.
speakers of these languages are found in the gambia, in the former casamance region of southern senegal and in guinea bissau.
the map in figure 1, taken from ethnologue, presents the languages of senegal.
the arrow on the map points to the eegimaa speaking area (bandial is the name used by ethnologue for eegimaa).
some of these communities will be referred to in our discussion of death prevention names in § 6.
for example, the name kusiilay 1 'the language of essil', is the name given by speakers of kujireray to the eegimaa language, because essil, of which bajjat was a district, is the village which has a border with their village.

the cruel murder of 50 people in new zealand was another tragic reminder of how humans are capable of heartlessly killing their own kind just based on what they believe, how they worship, and what race or nationality they belong to.
there is a longstanding history of the fear of "the others" turning humans into illogical ruthless weapons, in service to an ideology.
fear is arguably as old as life.
it is deeply ingrained in the living organisms that have survived extinction through billions of years of evolution.
its roots are deep in our core psychological and biological being, and it is one of our most intimate feelings.

importantly, studying eye movements offers an insight that does not depend on the participants' beliefs, memories or subjective impressions of the artwork.
previous eye tracking research has highlighted the potential to transform the ways we understand visual processing in the arts (see for example brieber 2014; binderman et al., 2005) and at the same time offers a direct way of studying several important factors of a museum visit (filippini fantoni et al., 2013; heidenreich & turano 2011; milekic 2010).
zurbaran's cycle of jacob and his sons has been on display in the long room at auckland castle for over 250 years.
it is the only cycle to be preserved in purpose-built surroundings in the uk, and one of very few of its kind in the world.
it has a long history in scholarship (baron & beresford 2014), but many key aspects of its production and significance have not yet been fully understood.
in this study we used eye-tracking in the first stage of exploring audience experience of the extensive spanish art collections of county durham, of which the 13 zurbaran artworks (there are actually only 12 zurbaran artworks, the 13th benjamin, is a copy by arthur pond) are a key part of, to investigate the ways in which audiences look at spanish art, how aesthetic experience is evaluated and whether audiences can be encouraged to approach art in different ways.
this pilot project primarily investigated how participants visually explore artworks and provides new insights into the potential eye-tracking has to transform the ways we understand visual processing in arts and culture and at the same time offer a direct way of studying several important factors of a museum visit, namely to assess the effects of label characteristics on visitor visual behaviour.

as a previous step to designing the mutation operators, we analyzed the main technologies used specifically in the development of gis, and we identified typical errors a programmer can introduce during the development.
these errors were formalized into mutation operators.
in order to apply these operators to a sut, we rely on java reflection and aspect-oriented programming.
reflection allows us to obtain the list of classes and methods of the sut, so the user can decide the methods to wish the operators will be applied.
later, we capture information about the methods of the sut to be mutated, together with the information of the mutation operators that were already defined.
from these data, we generate the mutation operator, in the form of on aspect, which will then be possible to interweave with the sut which generates a mutant of the sut.

thus, our study seems to have generated a more gradual and less pronounced change in the moment of inertia produced by the artificial tail, allowing experimental subjects to adjust to the posterior mass by adopting a more vertical position of the femur while standing.
interestingly, the femur kinematics during walking in our control-weight group resembles the results reported in the experimental subjects of carrano and biewener.
this suggests that their results could be partially explained as a response to the increased loading rather than to the displacement of the com.
however, substantial differences in hindlimb morphology between these groups make difficult to assess the validity of inferences obtained from such studies.
one caveat, however, is that our approach uses tail reduction as the mechanism for com displacement despite it has been recently shown that the evolutionary change in com position was driven instead by forelimb enlargement [8].
nonetheless, this does not mean that tail reduction had no effect on com displacement, but that it was not the most important factor.
ideally we would have increased tail mass and reduced pectoral limb mass but, unfortunately, this is not experimentally feasible.
thus, we expect that careful phenotypic manipulation of extant birds can open new avenues of experimental investigation into unexplored facets of dinosaur locomotor mechanics and energetics, providing a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between form and function in dinosaur evolution.

much more detailed speculation based on these scant historical details has been interpolated by many of galois' biographers (most notably by eric temple bell in men of mathematics), such as the frequently repeated speculation that the entire incident was stage-managed by the police and royalist factions to eliminate a political enemy. [14]
as to his opponent in the duel, alexandre dumas names pescheux d'herbinville, [13] who was actually one of the nineteen artillery officers whose acquittal was celebrated at the banquet that occasioned galois' first arrest. [20]
however, dumas is alone in this assertion, and if he were correct it is unclear why d'herbinville would have been involved.
on the other hand, extant newspaper clippings from only a few days after the duel give a description of his opponent (identified by the initials "l. d.") that appear to more accurately apply to one of galois' republican friends, most probably ernest duchatelet, who was imprisoned with galois on the same charges. [21]
given the conflicting information available, the true identity of his killer may well be lost to history.
whatever the reasons behind the duel, galois was so convinced of his impending death that he stayed up all night writing letters to his republican friends and composing what would become his mathematical testament, the famous letter to auguste chevalier outlining his ideas, and three attached manuscripts. [22]
mathematician hermann weyl said of this testament, "this letter, if judged by the novelty and profundity of ideas it contains, is perhaps the most substantial piece of writing in the whole literature of mankind."

some ants were infected with beauveria bassiana, a fungus.
infected ants chose food laced with toxic hydrogen peroxide, whereas healthy ants avoided it.
hydrogen peroxide reduced infected ant fatalities by 15%, and the ants varied their intake depending upon how high the peroxide concentration was.
in the wild, formica fusca can encounter similar chemicals in aphids and dead ants.
the independent reported self-medicating ants a first among insects.

ballet is less about learning the moves and more about perfecting them.
the moves themselves are relatively straightforward, but the positing, the timing, and the elegance required takes a lifetime of practice.
for this reason, it's always better to practice ballet in a ballet studio under the guidance of a good instructor, who will be able to correct your positioning and make sure that you're dancing properly.
a dancing studio is equipped with mirrors for correcting your positioning and seeing what you're doing accurately, and a barre for practicing. [1]
if you want to practice at home, make sure you've got enough open space to move freely, preferably on a hard wood floor.
the back of a chair can replace the need for a bar.
position a large mirror so you can check your positioning and see what you're doing.

about using connection files
a connection file stores information about a connection to a data source (such as an ole db data source) and the data associated with the connection.
in microsoft access, you can use a connection file to bind one or more data access pages to a data source.
when you open a page, access reads the connection file that is linked to the page, and based on the contents of the connection file, connects the page to the appropriate data source.
a connection file uses one of the following file formats:
office data connection (.odc)
a file format that uses html and xml to store the connection information.
you can view or edit the contents of the file in any text editor.

the reality is that it stands for and operationalizes us power, in cooperation with america's closest allies.
anyone who doubts that should review a recent letter orchestrated by the bretton woods committee, addressed to congressional leaders on behalf of an impressive array of former republican and democratic cabinet secretaries.
"the us does not dictate what happens at the imf, but it does have a disproportionate influence.
given the fund's origins in helping to rebuild europe after world war ii, european countries are also very well represented on its executive board and in terms of ownership shares (and thus voting weight on important decisions).
one major goal in recent decades has been to shift representation at the imf somewhat away from europe and toward the world's emerging markets.
(for the technical details, i recommend a recent paper by edwin m. truman, my colleague at the peterson institute for international economics.)
these reforms need to be agreed, in legislative form, by the us congress before they can take effect.
for whatever reason, president barack obama's administration did not push this item hard in 2013 and early 2014 - and the agenda of encouraging further imf reform has therefore languished.
the obama administration proposed to tie imf reform to the presumably imminent approval by congress of funding for ukraine.
this is sensible legislative tactics but not appealing as an economic strategy.
